        In this post, I will share my best-kept secrets about the famous tulip
        fields. I was contemplating whether I should share these or not because
        I do enjoy the exclusivity of my favorite places but at the end it’s
        really not fair to keep them a secret from other curious travelers that
        are willing to explore.

        April is coming. It doesn’t only mean that Dutch people are ready to
        chill at the beach in their swimsuits and even have some lekker ice
        cream but also that something wonderful and even magical is at the door…

        You’ve been waiting all year long, dreaming about the sea of flowers
        that you’re gonna run, laugh and have fun in. Except, you won’t. At
        least not in Keukenhof. Let me tell you why. Even if you get the tickets
        (17 Euro per person) and queue up behind the big bus tour groups, you’ll
        find out that the tulips are not approachable and most of the areas are
        closed by fences. The rest of the spots are crowded by people taking
        selfies with their sticks and families desperately trying to get a good
        shot. Honestly, it’s astonishing to see the millions of flowers and so
        lovely to walk around then enjoy a coffee at the restaurant. I’m not
        saying you shouldn’t go. But I know for a fact, that there are those
        people who want to wander, explore and get lost. The ones who are
        willing to take all the inconveniences, wake up early, do the research
        just in order to have something a little different.{" "}

      <p>
        If you’re like that, and you’re looking for a more exclusive and
        personal experience, feel free to follow my advice.{" "}

        So, first of all, you need a car. You can se Snappcar and rent from
        private people (like Airbnb but for cars) where you can find some good
        deals starting from 25 Euros. You can also get one at the airport
        (although it’s fairly expensive in April). I also recommend car sharing.
        Greenwheels is an amazing option and you only need your licence and
        credit card to sign up. Keep in mind though, that they only accept
        drivers licences from the EU, if you don’t have that, you need to apply
        for an international licence first.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Either way, once you get your car, you can head to Hillegom. There are
        some beautiful fields around town but since they change the location
        every year, it takes a bit of driving around to find them. (I always do
        the location scouting for my shoots at the end of March - I will update
        this post and share the spots once I find out the exact locations.)
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In Hillegom you can also visit{" "}
        <a href="https://www.annemiekespluktuin.nl/en/home/">
          Annemieke’s Pluktuin
        </a>
        , a nice tulip farm. Here you can not only go into the field but also
        pick your own bouquet (25 cents/piece). I mean how incredible is that!{" "}
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        If you already got tired exploring the bulb area, you can have some
        coffee, apple juice, and organic apple pie at the farm. <br />
        <br />
        After this visit, I recommend heading to De Tulperij. On the way, you
        will see many beautiful fields spreading over the main street. You can
        park by most of them pretty easily, walk up and take pictures. The
        general rule is, that you’re not allowed to walk into the fields since
        they are private property. If you do, you will immediately get the angry
        honking and yelling from random Dutch people passing by. <br />
        <br />
        In De Tulperij, which is a similar but bigger farm like the first one,
        you can also have delicious specialties, like tulip tea, tulip shots,
        and cakes.{" "}
