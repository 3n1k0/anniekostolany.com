    <p>In this post, I will share my best-kept secrets about the famous tulip fields. I was contemplating whether I should share these or not because I do enjoy the exclusivity of my favorite places but at the end it’s really not fair to keep them a secret from other curious travelers that are willing to explore.</p>
    
    <p>April is coming. It doesn’t only mean that Dutch people are ready to chill at the beach in their swimsuits and even have some lekker ice cream but also that something wonderful and even magical is at the door…</p>

    <p> the TULIP SEASON! </p>

    <p>You’ve been waiting all year long, dreaming about the sea of flowers that you’re gonna run, laugh and have fun in. Except, you won’t. At least not in Keukenhof. Let me tell you why. Even if you get the tickets (17 Euro per person) and queue up behind the big bus tour groups, you’ll find out that the tulips are not approachable and most of the areas are closed by fences. The rest of the spots are crowded by people taking selfies with their sticks and families desperately trying to get a good shot. Honestly, it’s astonishing to see the millions of flowers and so lovely to walk around then enjoy a coffee at the restaurant. I’m not saying you shouldn’t go. But I know for a fact, that there are those people who want to wander, explore and get lost. The ones who are willing to take all the inconveniences, wake up early, do the research just in order to have something a little different. </p>
    <br />
    <p>If you’re like that, and you’re looking for a more exclusive and personal experience, feel free to follow my advice. </p>
    <br />
    <p>So, first of all, you need a car. You can se Snappcar and rent from private people (like Airbnb but for cars) where you can find some good deals starting from 25 Euros. You can also get one at the airport (although it’s fairly expensive in April). I also recommend car sharing. Greenwheels is an amazing option and you only need your licence and credit card to sign up. Keep in mind though, that they only accept drivers licences from the EU, if you don’t have that, you need to apply for an international licence first. </p>
    <p>Either way, once you get your car, you can head to Hillegom. There are some beautiful fields around town but since they change the location every year, it takes a bit of driving around to find them. (I always do the location scouting for my shoots at the end of March - I will update this post and share the spots once I find out the exact locations.)</p>
    <br />
    <p>In Hillegom you can also visit <a href="https://www.annemiekespluktuin.nl/en/home/">Annemieke’s Pluktuin</a>,  a nice tulip farm. Here you can not only go into the field but also pick your own bouquet (25 cents/piece). I mean how incredible is that! </p>
    <br />
    <p>Here’s a video of me on the farm last year: </p>

    <p>If you already got tired exploring the bulb area, you can have some coffee, apple juice, and organic apple pie at the farm. <br /><br />

    After this visit, I recommend heading to De Tulperij. On the way, you will see many beautiful fields spreading over the main street. You can park by most of them pretty easily, walk up and take pictures. The general rule is, that you’re not allowed to walk into the fields since they are private property. If you do, you will immediately get the angry honking and yelling from random Dutch people passing by. <br /><br />
    
    In De Tulperij, which is a similar but bigger farm like the first one, you can also have delicious specialties, like tulip tea, tulip shots, and cakes. </p><br /><br />

    excerpt:
      "I first visited Haarlem in 2015, April as a tourist. We were living in Germany and decided to see my cousin in Maastricht, as a last minute idea, we wanted to spend a whole weekend in Amsterdam. I started my online research for a hotel, while we stopped at a gas station...",
    content: `<p>I first visited Haarlem in 2015, April as a tourist. We were living in Germany and decided to see my cousin in Maastricht, as a last minute idea, we wanted to spend a whole weekend in Amsterdam. I started my online research for a hotel, while we stopped at a gas station on the way (it really was last minute). <br /> I immediately realised how expensive hotel reservations were. I randomly found a really cute looking boutique hostel in a close-by city named Haarlem. When I called them, they told us that they only had one room left,  so I asked them to hold it for an hour until we got there. </p>
      <p>It was dark and raining when we arrived, but I immediately felt the special atmosphere of the quiet little streets, warm orange street lights and tremendous plants all over the city centre. <br />The hostel was one of the most interesting places I've ever been to; It is decorated with so much care and attention to detail, and they serve lovely breakfast so it was impossible not to love.<br /> We spent an amazing weekend in Haarlem, visited Amsterdam, had some space cakes, a lot of cheese and took plenty of photos, so we did all the touristy things we had to. </p>
      <br />
      <p>When it was finally time to leave and go back to Germany, I looked at my husband and said 
      “You know what? I feel like I could live here” and he nodded.</p><br />
      <p>
      Because of work commitments, we had to give up our Netherlands dream. Fast forward to 2017, we are sitting in our Los Angeles apartment, when he told me that we could move back to Amsterdam if we wanted to. <br /> As lovely as LA is, I immediately began to pack my luggage and search for flights, cause I felt an irresistible pull  coming from the picturesque street layouts, bridges and canals, millions of bikes, the international environment, the white sand beach and that was just the start. I was really excited to be a part of this atmosphere and I felt more inspired than ever to start our new life (That's about the time I started photography too, by the way). <br /> When we were looking for places to stay, we saw that Haarlem was a little bit cheaper and the connection was still very good with Amsterdam. For example, when I worked in Amsterdam on a daily basis I had to take the train which was in Centraal Station, in less than 15 minutes. Because of the area we chose, I actually traveled less than some of my colleagues that lived in the main city. 
      </p><br />
      <p>Haarlem is smaller and fewer tourists visit it. It has all the charm that Amsterdam has but at the same time you feel like you can breathe. It has many cute cafes and restaurants, I will make a list of my favourites and link it here soon.  </p>
      <br />
      <p>Recently, I started to schedule more of my photo sessions in Haarlem. I like to meet people right at the train station and walk around together. I have my preferred routes. There aren't many typical must-see things in Haarlem. There is a main square (Grote Markt), a church in the middle (Grote Kerk) and some great museums. But my favourite thing to do is just to wander around and take in the atmosphere.</p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>Here are some of my favourite photos I took of tourists visiting Haarlem: </p>

    <p>If you ever considered having a session with me, now you have the perfect opportunity. I'm organising a Boudoir Weekend on 1 & 2 of December. 
Doesn't matter if you have never had a professional photoshoot before. I have a lot of experience shooting everyday people and making them look like models. </p>

<p>Limited time slots are available for these days with a -10% discount on my regular prices. All you need to do is to choose a package you'd like to go with and send me a message to mail@anniekostolany.com. <br/>(Regardless of your package choice, unlimited champagne and fruit is available for all the ladies who book for this special weekend!) 
<br /><br />For more information please check ‘Investment’ and feel free to message me anytime if you're interested. </p>
