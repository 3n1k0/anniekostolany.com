        Although the Netherlands never enforced a real lockdown only looser and
        more lenient form they called ‘intelligent lockdown’, everyone tried to
        do their best and stay at home.

        The Covid-19 gave a hard time for the entrepreneurs of all around the
        world and a lot of us struggled to stay in a creative mindset. It was a
        great and difficult lesson for humanity and it thought us many things.

        Ever since we moved to Zandvoort from Haarlem, I’m discovering the
        beauty nature can provide. I go to the beach as much as I can and run in
        the National Park religiously. I discovered many beautiful photoshoot
        locations that are going to be so useful in the summer when the rules
        loosen up a bit more.

      <p>This boudoir session is a result of staying home for too long. </p>
