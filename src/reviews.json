  "A friend and I scheduled a joint boudoir shoot with Annie during my visit to Amsterdam, and in addition to having SO MUCH fun that afternoon, the photos ended up being more breath-taking than I ever could have imagined. Annie was terrific to work with, and made us feel comfortable immediately; her cues and tips make posing easy, and her sense of what will look incredible on camera (even if not intuitive to me) is spot on. I can't stop scrolling through my photos. Thank you, Annie! ‚Äî Kate Z.",

  "This photo shoot with Annie was a highlight of our trip. She‚Äôs so incredibly personable and friendly and was really flexible about rescheduling when I got a nasty cold in Amsterdam. Getting to know a new unexplored city with a someone who knew all the best spots for photos and a bit of the history and culture was incredibly fun. My fianc√© and I don‚Äôt just have a whole collection of gorgeous photos, but a really, really special memory of the afternoon we spent with Annie. She had excellent tips not just about locations for photos, but different poses and activities to try that made the whole experience really relaxed and so much more fun than I was expecting (as I‚Äôve felt kind of awkward in front of the camera in the past). Annie gave us a truly unique afternoon and even had recommendations for what to do with the rest of our afternoon in Haarlem. I truly cannot recommend this experience enough! ‚Äî Jessica",

  "I must say, when I signed up for this experience, I was trying really hard to not keep my expectations high..simply because it was the first time I was trying something like this and wasn‚Äôt sure how it would turn out to be. To say that I had an Amazing time with Annie would be an understatement! Right from the time I met her, she put me at ease with her approachable attitude and friendly demeanour...I‚Äôm so awkward with any kind of posing but Annie changed that! She chatted with me throughout so that I got comfortable around her and getting photographed in general. She has such an eye for detail - we ended up using my pretty little cupcake and camera as a prop for the shoot..Annie pays a lot of attention to foreground and clicked beautiful pictures of me in the best and most picturesque spots of Amsterdam. I was absolutely thrilled after such an amazing photoshoot and when she sent me the pictures, I was jumping with excitement at how she made me look! I got tons of compliments on the pictures. Oh, and also, she is such an amazing person to hang out with..I got some very useful photography and posing tips for her and also ended up exchanging notes on Instagramming over drinks! If you‚Äôre in Amsterdam and want someone to click beautiful pictures of you, I highly recommend her! Thanks Annie for making my trip memorable :) ‚Äî Saumya",
