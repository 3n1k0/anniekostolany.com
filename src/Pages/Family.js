              Annie is such a great and talented photographer! She did an
              amazing Job and we couldnÂ´t be happier. From beginning i knew she
              is the perfect photographer and person for my planned marriage
              proposal. She took care of everything so that the moment was just
              perfect. The location, lights, position everything was adoreable.
              Additionally she is such a warm Person and we felt really
              comfortable during the shoot! She captured our real emotions
              perfectly. We can recommend her to everyone!!! Annie - thank you
              so much.
              <br />- Sebastian W.
