			I tell you a secret about this session: we actually shot these
			photos around (and in) an office. Like, an everyday office. People
			tend to worry too much about location but I actually think it is not
			that important when it comes to portrait photogrpahy. I believe my
			best photos were taken at medoicre locations anyway. It might sound
			weird but usually an interesting color or the texture of a wall is
			more than enough to trigger my creativity. So if you struggle with
			this, I really recommend to walk around with your eyes open and
			learn to see.
