		<p>
			The Tommy Hilfiger HQ in Amsterdam was the perfect venue for this
			portrait session. I think it's very hard to tell that the location
			is actually an office where normal people do their normal jobs every
			day. It's also extremely stylish and the architecture is expectional
			so I think it comes without saying I had several shoots there
			already. Anna styled her own outfits and I think she did a great
			job.
