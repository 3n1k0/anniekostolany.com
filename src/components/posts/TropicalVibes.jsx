			This is an older project of mine but I'd like to share cause I still
			really like it. Sofia is a real beauty with interesting southern
			characteristics. This was actually the first time we worked
			together. I like her bubbly, flexible, cheerful personality a lot.
			She's also super smart, speaks a bunch of languages and still
			studying. Follow her on instagram @sofiacnk.
