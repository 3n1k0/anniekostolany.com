			According to the Cambridge online dictionary:
			<i>
				'a beautifully decorated room used in the past by a woman for
				sleeping, dressing, relaxing, and entertaining'
			</i>
			<br />(In sentence: "The next morning her ladyship was alone in her
			boudoir." )
		</p>
		<p>
			So as you can see, the word itself reaches way back into the past.
			Honestly, I hadn't even heard about boudoir until I got into
			photography. Later I found out that boudoir photos are usually taken
			in a bedroom, wearing next to nothing. It has a romantic and
			slightly erotic vibe, but it always stays classy and artistic.
		</p>

			Before I tried photographing boudoir, I wasn't completely sure it
			was something I liked. But a couple sessions later I can tell that
			it is definitely something every girl should try. It boosts your
			confidence ridiculously and helps A LOT to accept yourself. And why
			is it important at all?
		</p>
		<p>
			Imagine this: you wake up in the morning, full of confidence and
			energy, knowing that whatever happens during the day, it won't stop
			you. Since you already know that you are sexy as hell, it is one
			less thing you have to worry about, and you can focus on way more
			important things, like being more successful.
		</p>

		<p>
			I know how much energy it can consume to worry about your appearance
			because I have been there. And it is a very sad place for many
			reasons.
		</p>

		<p>
			It is sad because unfortunately society tells women, that they need
			to conform to certain standards to be accepted. It is sad because
			today a woman's worth is defined by her weight and appearance rather
			than her personality and her achievements. But it really doesn't
			have to be this way.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although you cannot change what everyone else is thinking, you can
			definitely change how YOU think. And this is where a boudoir session
			can help.
		</p>
		<p>
			Right now you might think it's not for you because you don't look
			like a model. But let me tell you something: it is not about trying
			to look like somebody else.
		</p>
		<p>
			It's about embracing your God-given body as it is, and feeling
			confident without being ashamed by what you believe your flaws are.
			That's right, you don't need to look like a model to have a boudoir
			session.
			<br />You don't even have to try to be perfect, or get a ton of
			makeup and change yourself so much, that even your own mother
			wouldn't recognize you. And the reason for it is very simple:
			because you are already more than perfect.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please remember that you only have one life and it wouldn't be fair
			if you'd spend most of it worrying about what other people might say
			or think about you. So forget all the bullshit you stress about,
			drink your wine, shove handfuls of popcorn in your mouth and laugh
			loudly. Don't be too polite to say "no" whenever you want to, wear
			too much makeup or do not wear any, apply to the job you are afraid
			to. I mean yeah, people have right to judge you for being confident
			in your own skin, but you also have the right not to give a fuck
			about it.
