     I sipmly LOVE to photograph couples. I always seek for the most perfect, authentic moments between them. 
     If I wait patiently enough, I can capture their love, passion and even respect, in a true, organic form. 
     I search for these moments on purpose because I believe they make all relationships one of a kind, and really special. What I mean is that there are no two couples who are exactly the same to each other. And this special bond is what should be remembered.</p>
    <p>It's no secret that most people are terrified in front of the camera. What they don't know is that it is so much easier to be done, when they are not alone.
     Being there with a partner saves a huge amount of stress. 
     As a photographer, I am really sensitive to people's insecurities, and I usually spot these issues way before we start the whole process. This simply guarantess that my clients have a great time without the fear of embarrassment or awkwardness.

      In-home sessions are a great way to show your personality on more than one level. Your apartment, choice of color and design add a lot to the photos.

    A few people know this, but location is actually secondary when it comes to photographing couples.

   <p>I love when I am able to unleash my creativity and work freely. I am a hopeless romantic soul, so the results are most likely to be the same.
