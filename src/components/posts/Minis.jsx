		<p>
			I love mini sessions so much. Langa Mngoma is a South African doctor
			AND influencer (so basically a superwomen). She contacted me when
			she visited Amsterdam in February. We were really lucky with the
			weather (even though it was SOO cold!), because normally it rains
			constantly around here.
		</p>
		<p>
			Amsterdam has the cutest locations, great architecture, a little bit
			of nature, charming little streets and the most important, infinite
			flowers.

		<p>
			Mini sessions are 30 minutes long, and they are a great option for
			bloggers and influencers too.

		<p>
			It's also a great possibiliy if you need a professional headshot,
			like a LinkedIn profile photo, or something to your blog's about me
			section.
		</p>
		<Photo file="mini/3.jpg" />
		<p>
			These sessions come with 10 carefully edited, high-resolution images
			picked by you.
