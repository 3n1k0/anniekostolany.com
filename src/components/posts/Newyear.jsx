  I love to work with clients so much, but when I make somebody else's idea happen, I always get a little less creative space than I normally prefer.
    I figured, that the solution for this is simply to arrange as many creative shoots on my own as I can. That way I can fulfil my urge to create, and still make everyone happy.
    Kady and Amanda came from England in January, we found each other on Instagram. We shot in my home in Haarlem, which is also my studio for now. They are both incredibly nice, funny and also very talented in makeup, so it was amazing to work together.
    I prepared the flowers the night before. I bought a bunch of fake flowers and craft supplies from a local hobbyshop, and spent a long night with a glue gun and a big glass of wine.
