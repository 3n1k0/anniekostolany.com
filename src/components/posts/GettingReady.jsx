			So let's say you'd like to have a photoshoot. First, you can start
			with creating a moodboard on Pinterest. It's a great source of
			inspiration and it will make communication easier between you and
			your photographer. The second step is to actually pick and book your
			photographer. Look for someone who has a similar style you're trying
			to achieve. When you find one, and pinpoint the date of your shoot,
			it's time to start your preparation mentally and physically too.
		</p>

		<h2>So what to do 1 week before the shoot?</h2>

		<p>
			It might sound funny, but one of the most important thing is to stop
			picking your pimples. I know that sometimes it's difficult to stop,
			but a single zit is easier to get rid of in post-processing, then a
			big red patch and an ugly scar. If you can afford it, it might be a
			good idea to get a facial one week before the shoot. It will
			minimize the chances to get huge breakouts on the following days. Be
			careful though, because depending on your skin type, it can also
			lead to redness and peeling. It might all seem really obvious now,
			but I followed these steps when I had my own wedding photoshoot and
			I was really glad I did. My skin is usually horrible, acne-prone and
			oily, but I got a couple facials (one month and one week before) and
			used face scrub regularly. I still do, but I really paid extra
			attention to it then. On my wedding day my skin was almost flawless.
			It made me really happy and boosted my confidence a lot. So believe
			me, I know what I'm talking about by not picking those little
			bastards.

			Also, please do yourself a favour and moisturize a lot. It is really
			important, because no Photoshop can help if your skin looks too dry
			and flaky. Your foundation will sit in all of your wrinkles, making
			visible even those you didn't know existed before.
		</p>
		<p>
			For men, I would recommend to shave in the morning, before the shoot
			to arrive with a fresh face. Try a new razor and use shaving foam
			and proper lotion after, to make sure you don't get too many of
			those red bumps.

			Get a nice manicure and a pedicure. It's easy to overlook these
			things but it is way more expensive to get the photographer fix your
			nails in post, then to clip and clean your nails before. Choose your
			outfits wisely, and don't forget to bring them! If there is more
			than one person in the shoot, pay extra attention to all of the
			outfits. The goal is not to match perfectly, but to wear something
			that harmonize in color and style. I always ask clients not to wear
			anything distracting: texts, too many patterns or bright, neon
			colors. Unless you have a fashion shoot, a simple, shirt or T-shirt
			is the best you can do. Don't forget to bring all the props you'd
			like to use. Hats, flowers, chalk tables, books, or anything that is
			important for you to be in the pictures.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ladies with long hair, if you wash your hair the day before, it will
			be a lot easier to deal with in the morning. Freshly washed hair is
			really difficult to handle, even hairdressers don't like it. Don't
			overdo makeup and if you use fake lashes, make sure, they are not
			peeling off. (If they do, it's better to remove them, because trust
			me, it will show.) Even if you don't wear full makeup, highlight
			looks really nice. If there are only three products you wear on your
			face, it should be foundation, lipstick and highlighter.

			Don't get drunk the night before. Not because I'm trying to be a
			party pooper but because literally no makeup can cover it. And
			swollen face and red eyes are really not appealing. Just get a
			plenty of rest, and drink a lot of water instead. Finally, just go
			to the shoot and be yourself. Have fun, enjoy the time and the rest
			is for the photographer.

			Feel free to use this list and please let me know if I forgot
			something.
