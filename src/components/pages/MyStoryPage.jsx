			<h2>My story</h2>

			<p>Hello, my name is Annie, I’m a Hungarian girl living in Amsterdam. I take photos and and I’m in love with it.</p>

			<p>I am constantly inspired by the beauty around me and my goal is for you to see the same way as I see.</p>

			<p>I studied literature, which taught me to express my thoughts but I have always been struggled with expressing my feelings.<br />I tried different forms of writing but I always felt somehow limited. It was not the language, it was me. I needed something else. That’s where my camera comes to the picture.</p>

			<p>I discovered photography in the beginning of 2017 and I immediately knew I found what I was looking for.<br />
			I teach myself from the internet every day and I constantly work on becoming a better photographer.</p>

			<p>I have been travelling in the past few months. I took photos in Germany, Hungary, France, the Netherlands, and in the States. Wherever I go I try to absorb as much as I can. <br />
			Not only because I think my photography might benefit from it but also because I believe that our world is a truly wonderful place and I need to see all of it.</p>

			<p>Genres I enjoy the most are portrait and couple shoots, but I would love to challenge myself as an event photographer too.</p>
