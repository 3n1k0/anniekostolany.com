		<p>Are you planning a big family event, a birthday or an engagement party?<br />
		When you put a lot of effort in organizing it, you may want to remember all the happy moments and lovely details, right?</p>

		<p>If your answer is yes, I can help you with this, just being there invisibly and documenting the most important moments of your life.</p>

		<p>These photos will also come in handy if you have loved-ones who cannot make it to the event and you donâ€™t want them to feel to be left out.</p>

		<p><a href="/contat">Send me an email</a> and we can set up a Skype call or meet for a coffee to discuss all of your ideas.</p>
