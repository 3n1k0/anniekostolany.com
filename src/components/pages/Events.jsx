		<p>
			Are you planning a big family event, a birthday or an engagement
			party? <br /> Doesn't matter if your family is big or small, I can
			help you to capture these special moments so you can treasure them
			forever.
		</p>

		<p>
			These photos will also come in handy if you have loved-ones who
			cannot make it to the event and you donâ€™t want them to feel to be
			left out.

		<p>
			Send me an email to mail@anniekostolany.com or fill out the form
			below and and we can set up a Skype call or meet for a coffee to
			discuss all the details.
