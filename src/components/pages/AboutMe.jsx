		<h2>About me</h2>

		<p>Hello, my name is Annie, I’m a Hungarian girl living in Amsterdam. I take photos and and I’m in love with it. </p>

		<p>I studied literature, which taught me to express my thoughts but I have always been struggled with expressing my feelings.<br />I tried different forms of writing but I always felt somehow limited. It was not the language, it was me. I simply needed something else. That’s where my camera comes to the picture.</p>

		<br>I discovered photography in the beginning of 2017 and I immediately knew I found what I was looking for.<br /> I teach myself from the internet every day and I constantly work on becoming a better photographer.</p>

		<p> Since I am way too sensitive, I laugh too much, talk crazy things all the time, cry at the news and make fun of myself. I appreciate life, all the beauty that surrounds us. That mostly where my inspiration comes from. I am also a very romantic person, I believe that everybody deserves true love. Maybe by now you understand why I am so attracted by couple shoots and wedding photography. </p> 
			
		<p>I have been travelling in the past few months. I took photos in Germany, Hungary, France, the Netherlands, and in the States. Wherever I go I try to absorb as much as I can. <br /> Not only because I think my photography might benefit from it but also because I have major wanderlust. Foreign cultures and the beauty of this world fascinated me more than anything.  </p>

		<p>The genres I enjoy the most are portrait and couple shoots, but I would love to challenge myself as an event photographer too.</p>

		<p>If you have any questions please don’t hesitate to email me at info@anniekostolany.com or by filling out the contact form.</p>
