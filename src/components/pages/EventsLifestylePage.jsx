		<h2>Events & Lifestyle</h2>
		
		<p>Are you planning a bigger family event, a birthday or an engagement party?<br />
		If you put so much effort in organizing it, you may want to remember all the happy moments and lovely details, right? I can help you with this, just being there invisibly and documenting the most important moments of your life.</p>

		<p>These photos will also come in handy if you have loved-ones who cannot make it to the event and you don’t want them to feel to be left out.</p>

		<p>Or, if you’re not having any special occasions but you have a beautiful family, let’s take some photos of them!<br />
		I, personally always got intimidated by studio shoots, and now as a photographer I feel that they are not so personal. If the client is not a professional model, poses and atmosphere can get really unnatural and even awkward.</p>

		<p>Instead of this, let’s go and have some hot chocolate together!<br />
		You will be having fun while I work from behind and the results will be some candid and happy captures of your real self that you will truly like!</p>

		<p>Send me an email and we can set up a Skype call or meet for a coffee to discuss all of your ideas.</p>
