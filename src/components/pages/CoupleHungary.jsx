		<h2> Romantic fall theme couple shoot </h2>
		<p>
			I must say, engagement photography is I love the most. I just really
			like how easy it is to work with couples who sometimes just happen
			to forget about the camera.

			Couple shoots in Amsterdam are really sweet and precious but I also
			enjoy to work in nature, as it gives me endless inspiration. We can
			discuss your ideas over a coffee or on Skype. I am also happy to
			help picking out the location and dresses so everything can match
			perfectly.
