<h3>So how does this work?</h3>
<p>First of all, you need to contact me with your idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are going talk about the location, the clothes, the makeup and the possible props.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's ok if you haven't figured out everything yet, I can absolutely help you with the planning.</p>
<p>When we agree about everything, we pick a time and a place where we meet.</p>
<p>The photoshoot will take one hour and we will be having a lot of fun!</p>
<p><br /> In 3-4 days I will send you a selection of preview images (not the full resolution yet). <br /> From these, you will be able to pick 25 of your favourite photos, which I`ll edit to perfection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I'm ready, I email you the instructions about accessing the online gallery from where you can download the retouched photos in full resolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's really quick and easy.</p>
<p>If you have any more questions, feel free to email me at info@anniekostolany.com or by filling out the contact form.</p>
