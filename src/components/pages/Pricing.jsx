<h3>Workflow</h3>
<p>After you contact me with your idea, we will discuss the location, the clothes I recommend, the makeup and the possible props.
It's ok if you haven't figured out everything yet, I can help you with the planning.</p>
<p>The photoshoot will take 1-1,5 hour and we will be having a lot of fun!</p>
<p>In 3-4 days I will send you a selection of preview images (not the full resolution yet). From these, you will be able to pick 25 of your favourite photos, which I`ll edit to perfection in my signature style.</p>
<p>It's really quick and easy.</p>
