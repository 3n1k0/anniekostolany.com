<h3>Workflow</h3>
<p>After you contact me with your idea, we will discuss the location, the clothes I would recommend, the makeup and the possible props, so everything about the styling.</p>
<p>The photoshoot will take 90 minutes, I will help you with the posing, and we will have a lot of fun!</p>
<p>In 3-4 days I send you a selection of preview images (not the full resolution yet). From these, you will be able to pick 25 of your favourite photos, which I`ll edit to perfection in my signature style.</p>
<p>It's really quick and easy.</p>
<p>If you have any more questions, feel free to email me at mail@anniekostolany.com or by filling out the contact form.</p>


<p>Delivery time can take up to 7 days.</p>

<p>Event photography and mini sessions are excluded from promotion. </p>
